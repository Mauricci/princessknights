# princessknights

This game project was made as a two week final project at the accelerated learning program Academy. 
It was made by Jimmy Edberg, Christopher Mauricci, Anna Wildt and Catrin Eckert.

It uses a SQL database and is written as an application in Java, where the JFrame library was used to create the graphical interface.

The working title was princess knights, but the game later became Asadotterns Omen. The game is a textbased roleplaying game, with the
goal of having strong female characters as its heroes. The world setting is todays Sweden, but where the old swedish tales has come to live
and are now infesting the world.
